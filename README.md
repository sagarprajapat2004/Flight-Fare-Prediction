This project is a robust Flight Price Prediction web application developed using **Flask**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and a trained Machine Learning model saved as `flight_fare_prediction.pkl`. The application predicts flight prices based on user inputs, delivering accurate and meaningful insights.

## 📌 Features

- **Accurate Flight Price Prediction**: Utilizes a well-trained machine learning model to provide reliable fare predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed with Flask, HTML, and CSS to ensure seamless user interaction.
- **Scalable and Modular Design**: Well-structured codebase for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Deployment-Ready**: Can be easily hosted on any cloud platform or local server.
